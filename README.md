Communicating the Story
What do I need to install? This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

NumPy pandas Matplotlib Seaborn




This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, 
- conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of your choosing using Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships.

In the second part,convey findings exploration to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, and create slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate the  results. This part of the project should make heavy use of the first part of the project. Select one or two major paths in your exploration, choose relevant visualizations along that path, and then polish them to construct a story for the readers to understand the findings
